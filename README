Notice(me senpai!)
==================

Notice(me senpai!) is an easy to use notepad. The main goal for the project is to create a simple
web application that is a little silly and not so serious. We started this project because we
needed something that you could use both on your smartphone and on your desktop computer.
Most of the notepad apps are created for smartphone use and it is impossible to get access to your
notes on a desktop. We are solving this problem since on Notice(me senpai!) everything is saved
in a database that is stored on a web server. Hence all of the information is accessible on any device
as long as you have stable internet connection.
